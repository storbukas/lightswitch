A settings-row in the SETTINGS-file looks like this

	1-2|0|0700|less|OFF|else

Lets write that as a text representation, to make it more understandable:

	OUTPUT_PINS | INPUT_PIN | INPUT_PIN_VALUE | RELATION_TO_INPUT_PIN_VALUE | ACTION_IF_RELATION_MATCHES | OPTIONAL_ACTION_IF_RELATION_NOT_MATCHES


Here is some examples with explaination:

	1|12|22.4|less|ON|else			--> if value on sensor 12 drops below value 22.4, pin 1 is being turned ON, otherwise, pin 1 should be OFF.
										like for example a heating element/oven that turns on if the degrees is dropping below 22.4

	2-4|0|0700|more|ON|not-set		--> if value on sensor 0 is more than value 0700, pins 2,3 and 4 (2-4) should be turned on (does not specify what
										should happen if it's less than 0700). examples are light than should be turned of in the morning, and then
										the user decides self when to turn them off again.
